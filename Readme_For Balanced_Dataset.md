# Classify Wikipedia Disease Articles for Balanced Dataset
[link to notebook](https://github.com/sarthaknikure/Classify-Wikipedia-Disease-Articles/blob/main/Balanced%20Dataset%20Model.ipynb)

When we look into original data there are 10000 dump files (records) in negative folder and nearly 3700 dump files (records) in positive folder. So nearly only 40% data for positive records. In my opinion this is unbalanced dataset. So I try to take only 4000 records from negative dataset. And tried to create a model.
